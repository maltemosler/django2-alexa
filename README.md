# Django2 app for creating Alexa Skills

From [Amazon's Docs](https://developer.amazon.com/de/docs/custom-skills/request-and-response-json-reference.html):
> Note: if you are using Apache HTTP Server to host your web service, use version 2.4.10 or later. Earlier versions of Apache HTTP Server send an "unrecognized name" warning if the server is not configured with a ServerName or ServerAlias in the configuration files. This prevents the Alexa service from sending the customer's request to your server. To address this, either upgrade to 2.4.10 or later, or add ServerName / ServerAlias to your server's configuration file.
